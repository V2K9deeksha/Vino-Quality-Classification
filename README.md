# Vino-Quality-Classification
This project utilizes Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to address high dimensionality in a white wine dataset. LDA aims to reduce feature complexity, aiding visualization and efficient model training. The project aims to uncover factors contributing to high-quality white wine production by classifying wine quality based on reduced features.
