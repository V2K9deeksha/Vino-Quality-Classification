# Wine Quality Analysis with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)

## Project Overview
This project employs Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to tackle high dimensionality within a white wine dataset. LDA is applied to reduce feature complexity, facilitating visualization and optimizing model training. The primary objective is to uncover key factors influencing high-quality white wine production by classifying wine quality based on the reduced set of features.

## Key Features
**Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)**: Utilizing LDA to transform the dataset and extract discriminant features, addressing the challenge of high dimensionality.

**Feature Reduction**: The project focuses on reducing the number of features to enhance visualization and streamline model training for improved efficiency.

**Wine Quality Classification**: Employing machine learning techniques, the model classifies white wines based on the identified discriminant features, providing insights into factors contributing to high-quality production.

## How to Use
### Clone the Repository:
